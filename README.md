# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process.

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

  1. Select My Operating System (OS)
Choose an Operating System:
For this assignment, I'll use Windows 11.
Steps to Download and Install Windows 11:

I will visit the Windows 11 Download page.
I'll follow the instructions to download the Windows 11 installation media.
I'll use the installation media to install Windows 11 on my machine.

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Choose an IDE:
I'll use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for this setup.
Steps to Download and Install Visual Studio Code:

I will visit the VS Code Download page.
I'll download the appropriate installer for Windows.
I'll run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

3. Set Up Version Control System
Install Git:
I'll visit the Git Download page.
I'll download the Windows installer.
I'll run the installer and follow the default settings.
Configure Git:

I'll open Git Bash (installed with Git).
I'll configure my Git username and email:

git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "my-email@example.com"

Create a GitHub Account:
I'll visit GitHub and sign up for a free account.

Initialize a Git Repository:
I'll create a new project folder on my local machine.
I'll open Git Bash in that folder.
I'll initialize a new Git repository:

git init

I'll create a .gitignore file to specify files to ignore.
I'll make my first commit:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes
Install Python:
I'll visit the Python Download page.
I'll download the Windows installer.
I'll run the installer, ensuring I check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

5. Install Package Managers
Install pip (Python):
Pip is installed by default with Python 3. I'll ensure it is working by running:

pip --version

6. Configure a Database (MySQL)
Install MySQL:
I'll visit the MySQL Download page.
I'll download the MySQL Installer.
I'll run the installer and follow the setup wizard to install MySQL.

8. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional)
Using Docker:
I'll visit the Docker Desktop Download page.
I'll download and install Docker Desktop.
I'll follow the instructions to complete the setup.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins
VS Code Extensions:
I'll open VS Code.
I'll go to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
I'll search for and install the following extensions:
Python
Flutter
Dart
Docker

Reflection: My extensions were taking too long to download turns out my Wifi was just slow and my laptop had too many cache files so I deleted them and connected to a stronger Wifi.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
